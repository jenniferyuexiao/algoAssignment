本周总结：
Tree作为面试常考和生活常备数据结构，应该熟练掌握：

Step1: Binary Tree
  Follow properties of a tree; 
  a node have at most two child nodes(left & right)

Step2: Binary Search Tree
  Follow properties of a tree; 
  a node have at most two child nodes(left & right); 
  left child of a given node should be less than equal to the parent value, right child should be greater than or equal to the parent value

Step3: N-node Tree
  Follow properties of a tree;
  a node can have any number of child nodes

其他由二叉树展开的更多树后面再继续总结，例如
Step4: AVL Tree
  Follow properties of binary search trees;
  self-balancing;
  each node stores a value called a balance facotr with is the difference in height between its left subtree and right subtree;
  all the nodes must have a balance of -1/0/1
